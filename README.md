As for x:
1) Add definition of insertMultiply to SimpleCalculator.java
2) Add implementation to "SimpleCalculatorImpl.java both or * insertion to the expression

3) Update tests - check that it multiplies and that it's successfully recognized as operation
(in my implementation it means also updating the list of supported operations)
4) Future step - update button listener to actually perform the operations
(adding* to the screen and returning output)

[ex 3 addition]
4)* add in x view in xml and add click listener in MainActivity
5) Test whether or not the button works in MainActivityTest
